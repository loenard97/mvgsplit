# LiveSplit.MVGSplit

A [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit) Component that autosplits speedruns for [Multiple Valve Games](https://www.speedrun.com/multiple_valve_games?h=Valve_Series&x=7kj893nd).

Still a work in progress, so I don't recommend actually using it.


## Credit
Splitting logic is based on these projects:
 - Portal 1: SourceSplit by [fatalis](https://github.com/fatalis/SourceSplit) and [2838](https://github.com/thisis2838/SourceSplit)
 - Portal 2: [SourceAutoRecord](https://github.com/p2sr/SourceAutoRecord) by the Portal 2 community
